	"description": "This tweak will let you get 1UPs from notifications! Set how many notifications it takes to trigger it, and you'll get a life and sound effect when you get enough. There's optional notifications that will pop up to show how many lives you currently have.<br><br>You can also set a custom sound effect to be played! I've found that a good way of setting it up is to email yourself a sound and open it with Filza. You can then easily move it to /Library/NotifLives/Sounds/. Then just change the Sound File in settings and test out your new sound!",
